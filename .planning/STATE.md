# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-12)

**Core value:** When disk usage changes unexpectedly, an agent can identify the largest growing directory trees and the evidence gaps behind `df`/`du` disagreements quickly and reproducibly.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — trusted-snapshot-collection

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (trusted-snapshot-collection) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-13 -- Completed 01-01 collect scaffold

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 4 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4 min)
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- The MVP validates the SQLite plus directory-aggregate model before any file-level persistence or observability expansion.
- Roadmap order follows the incident workflow: collect trustworthy snapshots, diff growth, explain evidence gaps, then automate ongoing collection.
- [Phase 01]: Collect requires an explicit TOML config file and keeps host roots out of implementation constants.
- [Phase 01]: The repo-local launcher bootstraps src directly so Phase 1 does not depend on an installed console script.
- [Phase 01]: Config-loading failures share a single JSON envelope keyed by config_error for agent-friendly handling.
